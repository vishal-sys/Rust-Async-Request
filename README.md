# Rust-Async-Request

This line fetches the content from the URL "http://httpbin.org/get" using an HTTP GET request.
The response from the server is stored in the res variable, which you can then use to access information such as the status, headers, 
and body of the response.
So, in a nutshell, the reqwest crate simplifies the process of sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses in Rust programs.
